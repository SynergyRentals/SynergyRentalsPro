Create a toggle feature labeled Autopilot Mode within the HostAI Task Inbox. When enabled, the AI should be allowed to automatically assign urgency, routing, and scheduling for incoming tasks without user interaction—but only if it has sufficient historical data and confidence from past manual decisions.

This feature is designed to reduce the number of tasks that require human review and streamline the flow of repeatable and predictable task assignments.

Functional Requirements
1. Toggle Component
Label: Autopilot Mode

Location: Top-right of the HostAI Inbox page

Toggle state: ON / OFF

Persist toggle status per user (use local storage or backend flag)

2. Autopilot Behavior (When ON)
When a new task is received from HostAI:

AI checks if the task matches a known task pattern based on past manual entries (by unit, guest message, type, and language)

If confidence is above the threshold:

Autopilot selects:

Urgency level

Routing destination (team)

Scheduling time

Task is automatically assigned and scheduled

A log entry is saved with decision metadata (who/what/why)

If confidence is below the threshold:

Task is held in the regular inbox for manual review

Guidelines for Autopilot AI Decision Rules
Confidence Requirements:
Minimum threshold of 85% confidence based on:

Matching title/description patterns

Unit-specific history

Guest message keywords

Manual override logs

Restrictions:
AI must not auto-assign or auto-schedule:

Tasks with incomplete reservation or unit data

Tasks marked as “uncategorized” by the model

Tasks at new properties with no history

Must provide a reason for its decision if auto-assigned (stored in task record)

AI Training Sources:
Past manual task routing decisions

Unit maintenance or cleaning history

Labels previously assigned by operations staff

Audit Log Requirements
Create a basic audit log (in memory or persisted) showing:

Autopilot decision timestamp

Task ID

Assigned urgency, team, and schedule

Model confidence score

Notes (why it chose the assignment)

Backend/API Integration
Toggle Control:

GET /settings/hostai-autopilot

PATCH /settings/hostai-autopilot
Payload: { enabled: true | false }

Decision Endpoint (when enabled):

POST /hostai/tasks/:id/autopilot-process
Automatically:

Assigns task

Schedules task

Logs routing

Audit Log:

GET /hostai/autopilot-log

POST /hostai/autopilot-log

UI Behavior Summary
When Autopilot is off: All tasks follow manual review flow

When Autopilot is on:

Qualified tasks skip manual inbox

Show confirmation toast: Task auto-assigned to Maintenance Team for Unit 53A – Scheduled Tomorrow at 2:00 PM

Unqualified tasks still appear in the manual inbox as normal
