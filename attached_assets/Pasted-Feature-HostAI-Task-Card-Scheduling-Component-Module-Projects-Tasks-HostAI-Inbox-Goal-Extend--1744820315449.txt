Feature: HostAI Task Card Scheduling Component
Module: Projects & Tasks > HostAI Inbox

Goal
Extend the existing HostAI Task Inbox feature by adding a scheduling component to the back side of each task card. Once the user selects both urgency and routing team, the card should flip and present a scheduling interface that helps determine the best time to assign and complete the task.

This component must:

Display the unit’s availability calendar

Offer AI-generated suggested scheduling times

Enforce scheduling logic based on the urgency level

Route the task to the appropriate team with a selected date/time

Finalize the task creation in the system once scheduled

UI Requirements
Trigger:
After the user selects both:

Urgency: High, Medium, Low

Routing Team: Cleaning Team, Maintenance Team, Internal Team, Vendor/Landlord
The card flips to show the scheduling interface.

Scheduling Card View Should Display:

Unit Name

Unit availability calendar (from internal booking/reservation system or iCal feed)

Guest reservation dates visually marked

Team availability (if available from future team scheduling module or hardcoded for now)

Suggested time slots based on urgency and routing team

Manual override option for date/time selection

Action Buttons:

Accept Suggested Time

Choose Manually

Confirm and Schedule Task

Scheduling Logic (AI/Rules-Based)
High Urgency

Must be scheduled same day or next day

AI should consider current time, team availability, and unit access

Auto-suggestion required for next-available qualified time slot

Medium Urgency

Should be scheduled on the guest checkout day

If routed to Cleaning Team, assign to that day's assigned cleaner

If routed to Maintenance, assign to a maintenance team member available that day

Low Urgency

Can be scheduled based on:

Team availability

Unit’s vacancy/turn calendar

Overall workload distribution

AI should suggest the most operationally efficient time slot in the next 5–7 days

Backend/API Needs
Use Existing:

/hostai/tasks for task metadata

/units/:id/calendar (new or existing) for unit-level availability

New Endpoint Suggestions:

GET /units/:id/schedule-options?urgency=low&team=maintenance

Returns suggested scheduling options

POST /tasks/schedule

Accepts: taskId, scheduledDate, assignedTeam/user, notes

State/Component Requirements
Flip card effect should use React animation (Tailwind or Framer Motion)

On scheduling confirmation:

Update task in database

Mark HostAI task as processed

Push to main task queue

Use useEffect to fetch availability and suggestions once flip is triggered

Use useState to manage selected date/time

Testing Guidance
Simulate task with each urgency level and routing type

Validate that card only flips after both selections

Confirm suggestions reflect proper scheduling logic

Check UI works with overlapping guest stays and limited team availability

Handle error states:

Calendar not loading

No time slots found

Task scheduling fails

Performance Notes
Cache unit calendar data when possible

Avoid loading full team schedules unless needed

Prefetch next 7 days for relevant units

Final Use
This component will be the final step of processing HostAI-generated tasks. Once scheduled, the card is removed from the inbox and task data is passed to /tasks.
