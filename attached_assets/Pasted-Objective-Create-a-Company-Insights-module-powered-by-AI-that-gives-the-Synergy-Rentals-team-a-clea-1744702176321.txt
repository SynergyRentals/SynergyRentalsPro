Objective:
Create a Company Insights module powered by AI that gives the Synergy Rentals team a clear, proactive view into the business’s health across revenue performance, guest reviews, operational metrics, and unit-level insights. The module should surface trends, detect risks, and suggest actions that lead to measurable improvement.

1. Module Name:

2. Core Sections
Create a sidebar entry called Insights that loads a dashboard with the following sections:

a. Revenue Insights
b. Guest Sentiment & Reviews
c. Operational Efficiency
d. Unit Health Scores
e. Proactive Recommendations (AI-Powered)
3. Section Details & Features
a. Revenue Insights
Purpose: Visualize income trends and spot revenue leaks.

Features:

Weekly, monthly, and quarterly revenue reports by unit, property, and co-host/arbitrage split

Occupancy rate vs. revenue performance

Average nightly rate trends

Underperforming units compared to comps (based on historical performance)

Cancellation trends

Seasonality mapping (automated trend detection)

Exportable charts for owner/client reporting

b. Guest Sentiment & Reviews
Purpose: Understand guest satisfaction and areas for improvement.

Features:

AI sentiment analysis of recent guest reviews and messages

Guest issue tagging (late check-in, supplies missing, cleanliness, etc.)

Alerts for review drops or clusters of complaints

Option to link flagged reviews to team task (QA, cleaner retrain, etc.)

c. Operational Efficiency
Purpose: Measure how well the team is performing on day-to-day execution.

Features:

Number of escalated guest issues

Average time to complete cleaning/maintenance

Inventory restock response times

e. Proactive Recommendations (AI-Powered)
Purpose: Use AI to provide actions you can take to improve key metrics before issues arise.

Features:

If reviews drop: “Consider retraining cleaners for Unit 53A based on past guest feedback.”

If occupancy is low: “Increase Wheelhouse minimum for weekdays in Unit 7B; you’re below comp rate.”

If maintenance spikes: “3 repeated issues in Unit 12 suggest plumbing inspection needed.”

If revenue falls: “Consider running a 3-night stay promo during shoulder season in September.”

AI-generated summaries: “This week, Synergy Rentals saw a 12% drop in weekend bookings across 2BR units. Consider adjusting pricing or running promos.”

4. AI Integration Requirements
Use OpenAI or other LLM API to analyze:

Booking data (revenue, dates, sources)

Guest message and review text

Task history

Maintenance logs

Pricing history (optional if integrated with Wheelhouse)

Create POST /insights/analyze endpoint to process summaries

Store results in insight_logs with timestamp, type, unit_id (if applicable), and actionability score

5. Backend & Tables (PostgreSQL)
insights: id, type, unit_id, title, description, created_at, insight_type, severity

unit_health_scores: unit_id, score, last_updated, notes

review_sentiment: unit_id, sentiment_score, trending_keywords, AI_summary

revenue_snapshots: unit_id, date_range, revenue, occupancy, ADR

efficiency_metrics: team_id, task_type, on_time_percent, avg_completion_time, period

6. Frontend Features (React + Tailwind)
Insight Cards (filterable by type, property, severity)

Insight Feed (like a timeline of AI-generated business intelligence)

Charts and Graphs (unit-level and company-wide)

Button to “Create Task from Insight” (assign follow-up action to a team member)
