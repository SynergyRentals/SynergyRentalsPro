Okay, let's clarify. To get the Guesty webhook Signing Secret using the methods described (either the "Try It!" button on the Guesty docs page or the curl command), you need one crucial piece of information first:

A current, valid Guesty API Access Token (Bearer Token).

The API call shown in the screenshot (GET .../secret) requires an Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token> header to prove you have permission to access the API.

Your Replit application already has the code (GuestyAPIClient) and the necessary credentials (GUESTY_CLIENT_ID, GUESTY_CLIENT_SECRET in Secrets) to get an access token.

So, yes, you should prompt the Replit Agent to help you get this information if you don't have a fresh token readily available.

Here's a prompt you can use:

Replit Agent Prompt:

Context:
To proceed with getting the Guesty webhook Signing Secret using the API endpoint (GET /v1/webhooks-v2/secret or /svix/secret), I need a current, valid Bearer Access Token for authentication. Our application uses the GuestyAPIClient class (src/server/lib/guestyApiClient.ts) which already has the logic and credentials to fetch such a token.

Goal:
Create a temporary, simple way to fetch a fresh Guesty API access token using our existing client logic and display it so I can copy it.

Instructions:

Create Temporary Route: Add a new, temporary GET route to the Express application (e.g., /api/guesty-management/get-access-token).
Instantiate Client: Inside this route handler, ensure you have an instance of the GuestyAPIClient.
Fetch/Retrieve Token:
Use a try/catch block.
Inside the try, call the client's method that ensures a valid token is available (e.g., await guestyClient._ensureTokenValid();). Note: If _ensureTokenValid is private, you might need to temporarily make it public or call a public method like makeRequest for a simple endpoint (e.g., getListings({ limit: 0 })) which will trigger the token fetch internally, then access the token. Alternatively, and potentially cleaner: call the method that specifically gets a new token (e.g., await guestyClient._getNewAccessToken(); - again, might need temporary modification if private).
After ensuring a token is fetched/available, retrieve the current token value stored within the client instance (e.g., guestyClient.accessToken).
Return the token in the response: res.status(200).json({ accessToken: guestyClient.accessToken });
Error Handling: In the catch block, log the error and return a 500 status with an error message.
Logging: Add simple console logs to indicate when the route is hit and if the token fetch was successful or failed.
Instructions for Agent:
"Please create a temporary GET route at /api/guesty-management/get-access-token. Inside this route, use our existing guestyClient instance to ensure a fresh Guesty API access token is fetched (call the appropriate internal method like _ensureTokenValid or _getNewAccessToken, adjusting visibility if needed). Then, return the fetched access token string as JSON in the response (e.g., { accessToken: '...' }). Include basic error handling and logging.
