Synergy Rentals – Company Overview & Service Capabilities

Company Overview

Synergy Rentals is a full-service short-term rental management company based in St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in February 2022, we officially began hosting on March 14, 2022. In just over two years, we’ve grown to manage 23 active short-term rental units across the St. Louis region—15 under a rental arbitrage model and 8 through co-hosting partnerships.

Our approach sets us apart from other STR operators in the market. We’re one of the five largest short-term rental hosting companies in St. Louis. With in-house cleaning operations, a full-time maintenance team, and 24/7 guest support infrastructure, we’ve designed our business for reliability and responsiveness. Our systems are powered by local knowledge, data-driven pricing, and AI-enabled messaging and task automation—all while maintaining strong community relationships and local compliance.

We position this offering as a way for property owners to reduce vacancy, stabilize income, and minimize tenant management needs.
